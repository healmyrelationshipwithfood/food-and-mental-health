      	<center><p><i>How do you relate to food? Is it a friend or foe?</i></p></center>

         <p>As human beings, we all must eat to live and sustain life. However, our relationship with food is complex, and often diffcult to understand. Our mind and our feelings can alter they way we preceive, prepare, and consume food. The relationship we have with what we eat is a building block for a fulfilling, functional life.</p>

         <p>In this workshop, you will learn many ways to gain insights into why you prepare and eat the food that you do. You will learn about different types of hunger, physical hunger and emotional hunger. You will learn about cravings, and how cravings relate to hunger. You will also learn about portioning food, and figuring out the portion size you truly want to eat.</p>

         <h3>Physical and Emotional Hunger</h3>
         <p>Hunger has two distinctive forms, phsyical and emotional. Our body usually experiences hunger when we need energy, or when our body is low on fuel. We need food to live. We need food for every single cell inside of us to grow, replicate, and function. However, we don't always eat when our body needs it. Sometimes we also eat when we are emotionally hungry, when we are depressed, anxious, or miserable. These two patterns of hunger can be difficult to tell apart. </p>

         <p><b>Physical Hunger</b></p>
         <ul>
            <li>Physical hunger comes on gradually.</li>
            <li>Physical hunger can wait.</li>
            <li>Physical hunger stops when your full.</li>
            <li>Eating to satisfy physical hunger doesn't make you feel bad.</li>
            <li>Physical hunger is open to options.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><b>Emotional Hunger</b></p>
         <ul>
            <li>Emotional hunger comes on suddenly.</li>
            <li>Emotional hunger feels like it needs to be satisfied immediately.</li>
            <li>Emotional hunger craves specific comfort foods.</li>
            <li>Emotional hunger isn't satisfied with a full stomach.</li>
            <li>Emotional hunger triggers feelings of guilt, weakness, and shame.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Cravings</h3>

         <p>Many people use food to fill what they lack inside themselves. We sometimes crave specific foods when we lack the foundation of our core self. When the tolls of our lives regarding relationships, work, and daily habits create holes within our souls, we look for quick fixes. Eating doesn't have to make you sad, depressed, or frustrated. In fact, food can even be a medicine for the body. To be happy when you eat, you have to have a good relationship with YOU. The foundation of relating to food is the relationship you have with your self.</p>

         <h3>Portions</h3>
         <p>A healthy, functioning relationship with food is also built from eating the right amount of food. The mind plays a large role in how we perceive and interact with different amounts of food. While satisfying emotional hunger, one can become disassociated from what they are eating and lose awareness. This causes us to eat more than what we originally intended.</p>

         <p> During this class, I will demo different portioned containers of food. I will give examples of how to divide and portion food, and how to judge the amount of food you need to eat.</p>
